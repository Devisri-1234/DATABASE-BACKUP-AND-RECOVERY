*DOMAIN*: SQL

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: üìù Task Description:
This task focused on understanding and implementing database backup and recovery mechanisms, a critical aspect of database administration and business continuity planning. The goal was to safeguard the database by creating structured backups and then performing a restoration simulation to validate the process.

The steps performed include:

Backup Process:

Used SQL mysqldump commands (or equivalent backup scripts) to export the entire database schema and data into a .sql file.

Ensured the backup included table structures, constraints, and all inserted data.

Simulated Failure / Reset:

Dropped the existing database to simulate a failure scenario.

Verified the absence of tables and records post-deletion.

Recovery Process:

Used the previously generated .sql backup file to restore the entire database using SQL execution.

Ensured all tables, data, and relationships were successfully recovered.

Validation:

Queried the restored database to verify record count and data accuracy.

Compared pre-backup and post-recovery states to confirm completeness.

üíª Tools Used:
OneCompiler.com (SQL) ‚Äì Used to simulate backup and restoration processes using SQL scripts in an online environment.

Manual SQL Scripting ‚Äì Created and tested DROP, CREATE, INSERT, and RESTORE commands using SQL.

VS Code / Notepad++ ‚Äì For writing, editing, and formatting SQL backup files.

Command-Line Simulation (for documentation) ‚Äì Demonstrated how mysqldump or equivalent PostgreSQL dump commands work in a real-world setup.

üì¶ Deliverables:
‚úÖ Backup Script:
SQL dump file containing CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, and other necessary statements.

‚úÖ Recovery Script:
SQL script used to recreate the database from the backup file.

‚úÖ Documentation:
Step-by-step explanation of the backup and restore procedure, tools used, and verification steps performed.
